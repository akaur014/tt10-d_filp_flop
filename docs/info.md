## How it works

A D flip-flop is a digital circuit that stores a single bit of data. It's a clocked sequential logic circuit, meaning it changes its output based on the data input and a clock signal. Essentially, it captures and holds the value present at its input (D) when the clock signal transitions from low to high (rising edge). 



## How to test

D_n = 0 | Q_n = x | Q_(n+1) = 0
